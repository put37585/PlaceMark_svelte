# PlaceMark

PlaceMark is a application that lets you manage all the nice places you have been to.

## About
This is part of an assignmet for the course 'Advanced Full Stack Web Development' (KASD) by Eamonn de Leastar.

University: Ostbayrische Technische Hochschule Regensburg

The project is split in to two parts:
1. The backend with an API for creating categories and points of interests. You can find the repository [here]( https://github.com/put37585/PlaceMark). You may also try it your self
[here](https://placemark-ksda.herokuapp.com).

2. A more dynamic frontend using svelte. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/put37585/PlaceMark_svelte). You may also try it your self
[here](https://placemark-kasd.netlify.app).
Additional information around the subprojects can be found on the corresponding GitHub page.

## Description

This part of the project focuses on the frontend.\
It is implemented as a single page application using svelte.

The project uses the API of the other part of the [project] (https://github.com/put37585/PlaceMark). A full documentation of the API used can be found [here](https://placemark-ksda.herokuapp.com/documentation).

Like the other part of the project, you can create categories for your points of interests. Then add some points to a category. After adding a title, a description and coordinates you can upload images to a place.\
Multiple images are shown in a carousel.

All points can then be viewed on a map. In the category overview you can hide the points of different categories.\
The maps are provided by [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com).

## Project Status
Overall most features where implemented.\
Mostly the UI needs some improvements. I know it does not look fancy, but the project is more about functionality.

## Deployment
This project is hosted on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
